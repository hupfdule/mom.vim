mom.vim
=======

Syntax highlighting for mom, a troff macro package, or as
link:https://www.schaffter.ca/mom/[mom's homepage] states:

[quote, Peter Schaffter, MOM macros for GNU troff]
____
mom is a flexible typesetting and document formatting package that allows
you to create high-quality Portable Document Format (.pdf) or PostScript
(.ps) files for viewing and printing.
____

This script is specialized for mom, although that is a troff macro package,
this script does only have limited troff highlighting capabilities.

Changes to upstream
-------------------

This fork actually only puts this into proper vim plugin form and provides
an ftdetect script for files ending in `.mom`.

The original script can be found at
http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=1231.
