Syntax highlighting for mom, a troff macro package, or as mom's homepage (http://faustus.dyn.ca/mom/mom.html) states: "mom is a typesetting and formatting package used to create high-quality, PostScript documents for printing."

This script is specialized for mom, although that is a troff macro package, this script does only have limited troff highlighting capabilities.
